# Matlab-CurvatureSensor
Reconstruction algorithm for curvatures sensing from intensity distributions

Curvature sensing is based upon the work of Rodier (et al.).  It is based upon the *Transport of intensity* equation (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport-of-intensity_equation)

This particular implementation is based upon work published by J. Zhang "On a universal solution to the transport-of-intensity equation" and the code posted with this paper.  It is intended to resolve the phase curvature from intensity patterns displaced by a distance.
